**ResNet**

*ResNet* means *Residual Networks*

In this part, you will learn to implement a skip connection in your network
Basically you will implement the basic building blocks of ResNets in a deep neural network using Keras and then put together these building blocks to implement and train a state-of-the-art neural network for image classification
