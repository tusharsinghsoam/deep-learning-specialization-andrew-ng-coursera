# Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew NG on Coursera

This repository contains the quizzes and solutions for all the assignments of the Coursera's [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) offered by `deeplearning.ai`. I have taken help from several repositories mentioned below and wanted to thank them and Andrew NG big time.

## Disclaimer

This repository is only meant for being used as a help by those who get stuck somewhere. It may help them to save some time. I strongly recommend everyone to not directly copy any part of the code (from here or anywhere else) while doing the assignments of this specialization. The assignments are fairly easy and one learns a great deal of things upon doing these. Thanks to the deeplearning.ai team for giving this treasure to us.
